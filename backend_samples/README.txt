FOR JEFF

models.py 
Here is some code from a previous project I worked on. There is a model, Post, which holds info that Facebook does about a certain post.
Each Post could be a reply of another, in which case the reply_to field is filled in.

serializers.py
This is part of the Django REST Framework. This framework could make things even easier when working with models and REST.
The serializers format the data before it is shown to the user. http://www.django-rest-framework.org/

views.py 
This is still part of the Django REST Framework. Here the querysets are being specificied.

urls.py
This is part of the Django REST Framework. It maps the URLs to the views.
